# Health Insurance Cost Forecasting Based on Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview

This project aims to forecast health insurance costs using multiple linear regression. The analysis is based on a dataset containing personal attributes, such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and health insurance charges. By using regression techniques, we aim to identify the factors that influence insurance costs and predict future insurance charges for individuals based on their characteristics.

## Purpose

The cost of health insurance is a significant concern for individuals, families, and policymakers. Understanding the factors that contribute to these costs is crucial for making informed decisions about choosing insurance plans, pricing strategies, and healthcare policy reforms. This project aims to:
- Identify key variables that affect health insurance costs.
- Use statistical models to predict future insurance charges.
- Provide insights into the drivers behind changes in health insurance costs.

## Methodology

We employ **Multiple Linear Regression** as the primary method for studying the relationship between independent variables (such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, etc.) and health insurance charges. This method allows us to predict future costs based on personal attributes.

### Key Variables:
- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **Sex**: The gender of the individual (male/female).
- **BMI**: The Body Mass Index of the individual (a measure of body fat).
- **Children**: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (Yes/No).
- **Charges**: The health insurance charges (the dependent variable we want to predict).

### Approach:
1. **Data Collection**: We use the "Medical Cost Personal Datasets" to train and test the regression model.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships.
3. **Model Training**: We will build and train a multiple linear regression model on the dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: We will evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Medical Cost Personal Datasets**. It contains information on:
- Age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and the medical insurance charges for a set of individuals.
- This dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
